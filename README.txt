ESAT OBC library version 4.5.0.

On-Board Computer (OBC) for ESAT.

This software runs in the ESAT OBC board.  Use it with Arduino 1.8.0
or newer together with the Arduino core for MSP430-based ESAT boards
(Theia Space's ESAT Boards (MSP430)) 3.1.0 or a newer 3.x.y version
and the ESAT utility library (ESATUtil) version 2.1.0 or a newer 2.x.y
version.  Use ESAT-OBC as the target board.  Depending on your ADCS
module, select ADCS Code Running in ADCS (option ADCS=ADCS, for newer
ADCS boards with a standalone microprocessor) or ADCS Code Running in
OBC (option ADCS=OBC, for legacy ADCS boards controlled by the OBC
board).  For option ADCS=OBC, use the ESAT ADCS library (ESATADCS)
version 3.2.0 or a newer 3.x.y version.

See the example OBC program (examples/OBC/OBC.ino).  This program uses
the modules of the OBC library.

The src/ directory contains the OBC library (ESAT_OnBoardDataHandling)
as well as several subdirectories:


# ESAT_OnBoardDataHandling

On-Board Data Handling (OBDH), which is the main function of the OBC.
This library provides the general OBDH library functionality.


# ESAT_OBC-subsystems directory

Subsystems managed with ESAT_OnBoardDataHandling.


# ESAT_OBC-hardware directory

This directory contains drivers for the peripherals of the ESAT OBC
board used by ESAT_OBCSubsystem.


# ESAT_OBC-telecommands directory

This directory contains telecommand handlers used by ESAT_OBCSubsystem.


# ESAT_OBC-telemetry directory

This directory contains telemetry packets used by ESAT_OBCSubsystem.
