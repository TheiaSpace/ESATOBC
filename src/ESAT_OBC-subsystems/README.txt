ESAT OBC subsystems.  ESAT_OnBoardDataHandling uses them.


# ESAT_Subsystem

The on-board data handling library manages subsystems by means of
objects that implement the ESAT_Subsystem interface.


# ESAT_ADCSSubsystem

Attitude Determination and Control Subsystem.  Either communicates
with the ADCS board (option ADCS=ADCS, for using together with newer
ADCS boards with a standalone microprocessor) or wraps the ESAT_ADCS
library (option ADCS=OBC, for using together with legacy ADCS boards
controlled by the OBC board).


# ESAT_EPSSubsystem

Electrical Power Subsystem.  Communicates with the EPS board.


# ESAT_OBCSubsystem

On-Board Computer subsystem.


# ESAT_ThermalPayloadSubsystem

Thermal Payload subsystem.  Drives the Thermal Payload board.


# ESAT_WifiSubsystem

Wifi communications subsystem.  Communicates with the Wifi board.
