* Changes in ESATOBC 4.1.0, 2018-10-24

** Some errors have been fixed.

** The OBC subsystem can produce multiple telemetry packets.

** There is a new OBC lines telemetry packet.

** The OBC subsystem accepts pluggable telemetry and telecommand packets.

** There is a driver for the on-board LED of the new OBC boards.

** All computer code files have copyright notices.

** The main program shows the program name and version in the header.

** The complexity of pasing around CCSDS Space Packets in KISS frames
has been reduced with the help of new modules form ESATUtil.

** There is support for multiple EPS packets with the EPS interface
version 2.1.0 or a newer 2.x.y version, but the EPS interface version
2.0.0 or a newer 2.0.y version is still supported.

** The ADCS can run in a separate board running the ADCS
interface version 3.2.0 or a newer 3.x.y version, but running the ADCS
in the OBC through ESATADCS 3.0.0 or a newer 3.x.y version is still
supported.

** There is support for Wifi telemetry packets with the Wifi interface
version 2.1.0 or a newer 2.x.y version, but the Wifi interface version
2.0.0 or a newer 2.0.y version is still supported.
